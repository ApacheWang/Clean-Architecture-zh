# Part4. COMPONENT PRINCIPLES

If the SOLID principles tell us how to arrange the bricks into walls and rooms, then the component principles tell us how to arrange the rooms into buildings. Large software systems, like large buildings, are built out of smaller components.

In Part IV, we will discuss what software components are, which elements should compose them, and how they should be composed together into systems.
